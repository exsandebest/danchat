# Structure of main directories
* **You have to fill these directories with necessary files to correct work**  
* **You also have to create and fill `config/.env` with necessary data, see [`config/.env.example`](https://github.com/exsandebest/danchat/blob/master/config/.env.example) as example and uncomment lines 3-5 in [`app.js`](https://github.com/exsandebest/danchat/blob/master/app.js) to use these constants**  
*They were commented because of using heroku*
